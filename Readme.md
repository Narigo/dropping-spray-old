# Dropping spray

Finally a spray that drops when spraying too much on the same spot.

See [a live demo](https://narigo.github.io/dropping-spray).

## Building

To build the demo, run `npm run build`.

## Usage

First of all, you need to decide what the spray should look like. There are a few customization possibilities that you
can provide. Below you can see the default options, which will be set if you don't provide an object or leave out fields
inside of it:

```
var Spray = require('./spray.js');
var spray = new Spray({
  color : {            // the color of the spray
    r : 0,             // red
    g : 0,             // green
    b : 255            // blue
  },

  size : 5,            // the size of the center circle that will always be filled

  splatterAmount : 10, // the amount of circles it draws in each step (usually during `requestAnimationFrame`)

  splatterRadius : 20, // the radius of the spray 20

  dropper : true,      // whether the spray drops (`true`) or not (`false`)

  dropThreshold : 50,  // when the spray should start to drop - it accumulates the amount of spray inside of the size
                       // and starts to drop when it reaches the threshold. Think of `dropThreshould / size` is the
                       // amount of `requestAnimationFrame`-calls the spray would need to start dropping.

  dropSpeed : 3        // how fast the drops should flow as soon as they started
});
```

For the spray to know where to draw to, you need to select a drawer. With a drawer, the spray is able to draw on
whatever surface the drawer provides.

In our example case, we use the `CanvasDrawer` to draw shapes on a canvas.

```
var CanvasDrawer = require('./canvas_drawer.js');
var shapeDrawer = new CanvasDrawer(document.getElementById('myCanvas'));
```

To be able to optimize our `requestAnimationFrame` calls, you need to call the `draw` method of the spray inside of it
and tell it whether it needs to draw at a specific coordinate or should draw just because there might still be drops
left. The `draw` method will tell us, whether the spray has some drops left to render.

A typical `requestAnimationFrame` could look like this:

```
var spraying = true; // sprays at a
var currentCoords = { x : 0, y : 0 }; // the coordinates where to draw, if spraying

function render() {
  var stillDrawing = false;
  if (spraying) {
    stillDrawing = spray.draw(shapeDrawer, currentCoords);
  } else {
    stillDrawing = spray.draw(shapeDrawer); // for drops only
  }

  if (stillDrawing) {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }
}
```


### Full example

```
var CanvasDrawer = require('./canvas_drawer.js');
var Spray = require('./spray.js');
var spray = new Spray();
var shapeDrawer = new CanvasDrawer(document.getElementById('myCanvas'));

var myX, myY, spraying; // Saves state for coordinates and if spraying

document.addEventListener('mousedown', startSpraying);
document.addEventListener('mousemove', updateCoords);
document.addEventListener('mouseup', stopSpraying);

function startSpraying() {
  spraying = true;
  render();
}

function updateCoords(e) {
  myX = e.pageX;
  myY = e.pageY;
}

function stopSpraying() {
  spraying = false;
}

function render() {
  var stillDrawing = false;
  if (spraying) {
    stillDrawing = spray.draw(shapeDrawer, { x : myX, y: myY });
  } else {
    stillDrawing = spray.draw(shapeDrawer); // for drops only
  }

  if (stillDrawing) {
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }
}

requestAnimationFrame(render);
```
